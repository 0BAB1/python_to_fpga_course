# LAB 3 Presentation

FINN Provides a very neat runtime environement based on Pynq to run FPGA inference directly from a notebook.

However, you might want to run inference on other (unsuported) FPGA boards. Given that only 2 boards are made for PYNQ and only [a few](http://www.pynq.io/boards.html) are officially supported at the moment, we will do the FPGA inference manually.
This allows for better understanding and flexibility for your future projects.

To do so, we will go over various steps to make it work.

- 0 => Find the FINN exportoted stitched IP and integrate this to your vivado project
- 1 => Create our own "glue logic" IP to interface between the model and Xilinx's DMA IP
- 2 => Run synth & impl and export to vitis
- 3 => Create software to run inference using DMA's drivers

## What is in this folder ?

This folder contains :

- HARDWARE : The glue logic IP's System Verilog code (use ```git clone --recursive https://github.com/0BAB1/python_to_fpga_course.git``` flag to clone the sub repo if needed or access it [here](https://github.com/0BAB1/Axi-Stream-FIFO-for-FINN))
- SOFTWARE : The code we'll run in Vitis
- SOFTWARE : A data generator for C inference of MNIST data.
- A LAB MANUAL

# LAB 3 MANUAL

## 0 : Find the FINN exportoted stitched IP and integrate this to your vivado project

During LAB 2, we used FINN to generate a "stitched IP" that conviniently generated a zynq project for us. Regardless of the workflow you chose (FINN has multple workflows like a [CLI](https://finn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/command_line.html) or [Custom builders](https://finn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/command_line.html) that does all we did in LAB in a automated way), you will always have a collection of outputs including :

- The different layers as IPs
- A stitched IP

After LAB 2, you can access the stitched IP by opinning the ```/tmp/finn_dev_yourusername``` folder, you will then find a range of output product.
We are going to focus on the ```vivado_zynq_xxx.../``` folder and open the .xpr using vivado.

## 1 : Create our own "glue logic" IP to interface between the model and Xilinx's DMA IP

With the output vivado project oppened, we will now proceed to delete every IP used in the block design **except for the stiched IP**, we will keep it a build our system around it.

As we can see, the stiched IP is very conviently packed with simplifed stream interfaces and expects a 8bits input for the data, just as planed !

But there is a problem : to transfer data, we will use Xilinx's DMA IP that need TLAST signal to function properly.

You can create a custom FIFO IP using the HDL in this repo's folder in order to handle the correct signals assertion for DMA to function properly.

Then add this custom IP Right after the FINN IP.

We then add the usual DMA etc.. to send data to the model via AXI Stream directly from memory. [Here is a small tutorial illustrating how to use DMA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aySO9jCKj9g)

The end custom system should then look like this :

## 2 : Run synth & impl and export to vitis

This step is not a step per say, you simply have to generate a bisteam and export the resulting hardware to Vitis so we can use the drivers to generate some software

## 3 : Create software to run inference using DMA's drivers

Once in vitis with platform & app components created, you can take inspiration from the code in the repo's "vitis prgram folders".

You also have, in this repo, a main.py file that will generate random quantized (UINT8) data alongside the corresponding labels and put these in a header file to use in our software.

Be sure that your heap and stack size complies with the number of samples you will load in memory (I use 0xf000 for both stack and heap to run this example).

## 4 : What is next ?

- Open UART tty
- Run debuging mode, observe results
- Compare FPGA accuracy with python simulations (asserted equal)
- Use system ILA to debug DMA & Drivers problems

Do not hesitate to open an Issue or contact if you have a problem. Here is a final output example :
